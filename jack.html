      <p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><b>Jack</b> is a bouncing lad whose 
        enthusiasm for life is enough to drive his parents and brother to distraction. 
        He has a keen sense of style and likes to look like a cool dude. He is 
        fond of computer games, football, singing, yelling, and throwing things. 
        He talks a great deal, and has very firm views about many things, which 
        he is not reluctant to share with others. He has an immensely loud voice 
        which he uses to good effect most mornings.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left">
     <font face="Verdana"><i>&quot;Thank you for the new letter. There was a
     book and a piece of Lego in it! I thought the card with a picture of
     kittens playing with some paper was fine. And then they was running about
     and scared a bird away. And then the bird flied away and went on a wall.
     And then someone saved her and then a wolf killed the kittens! A bird
     killed the wolf! And then a cat killed the bird. And then all the persons
     died. And then the bird came alive again, and that bird was dead again. And
     they all went inside and then they played in the bedroom. And then they
     said 'eee&quot;, the kittens. No-one died. No-one killed no-one again. They
     promised they wouldn't kill anyone ever again. They all went to bed and
     they slept and closed their eyes. And then that's the end.&quot;&nbsp;</i></font>
