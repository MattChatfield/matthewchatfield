<h1><font face="Verdana">What happened to 'Matt &amp; Babs Home Page'?</font></h1>
<p><font face="Verdana">Or, indeed, what happened to Matt and Babs? Well, for
the full story you'd have to ask them, but just to explain the bare facts, Matt
&amp; Babs were married for 12 years, and separated in 2003. They continue to
share the delights of looking after Billy and Jack, and are both still living
near to each other on the Isle of Wight. </font></p>
