      <p><font face="Verdana">Finding myself newly separated I was bound to seek a flat in true Weekend Dad
style. Luckily I located one that had a number of favourable features. It's in
the delightful resort of Ryde, close to the extensive amenities that town
offers, and is the basement flat of a large Victorian 4-storey block of flats.</font></td>

<p><font face="Verdana">It has panoramic views... of dustbins. There's room for the boys to doss down
from time to time which they eagerly do. It's not the lightest place in the
world, nor the largest, but it's mine (so long as I pay the rent). If you want more detail, come and see
me.&nbsp;</font></p>

<h2><i><font face="Verdana">1999-2003: Lake, Isle of Wight</font></i></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana">I lived in an Edwardian house in a quiet street in Lake, which is between the
seaside resorts of Sandown and Shanklin on the Isle of Wight. I grew up in
Sandown and the house is not far from my old house.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The house has a living-room and a knocked-through kitchen, which forms the
main living space. Everything goes on in there. In the front there is a room
surprisingly enough called the front room. Jack called it the front bedroom, for
reasons he refuses to explain. In there was the TV and loads of books: since I
moved out Babs now uses it as a studio.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Upstairs there are three bedrooms and a minute bathroom.
There is a small but
very fine garden, which served not only as my country estate but also as
football pitch, cricket wicket, campsite, outdoor laboratory, cycletrack, dining
room, cats toilet and just about everything else.&nbsp;</font></p>

<h2><em><font face="Verdana">1997-1999: Southend-on-Sea</font></em></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana">We lived in a Victorian terraced house down a quiet street in Southend-on-Sea. The area
was apparently cheap to buy in because it was near the red light district, but we
didn't make a penny. A few minutes walk away was Southend Pier, the longest pleasure pier
in the world. And very pleasurable it is, too. The sea itself was any time between 15
minutes and 45 minutes walk, depending on the tide.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana">We had a big knocked-through room in the front, where we lounged about and the TV,
computer, toybox etc lived. Behind this is what we laughably called the morning room. The
only reason for this is that, having read too many estate agents blurbs, we got in the
habit of calling downstairs rooms with no other apparent function a morning room. Why do
estate agents call such rooms morning rooms? I do not know. Do you? Behind that splendid
room was the kitchen, which was not too bad. It was certainly the biggest kitchen we
had
ever had at the time. It would probably have been possible to swing a cat in it, and indeed, I
was several
times tempted to do this. Out the back was a lovely little garden. The great thing
was,
we could do the gardening in about 5 minutes. This was better than the Warden's House,
Wicken, where we used to live. There it took three days just to cut the hedges. It also
meant that&nbsp; at long last, I now owned a tree. Yes, a tree. In fact several little ones.
Upstairs we had a big front room for me and Babs, another room for Jack the Lad, one for Bill the
boy, and a bathroom. You know the sort of thing. The great thing about this house
was that
upstairs again there was an attic room where Babs keeps her art stuff, and
retreated to gaze
at the sky out of the skylights. A garret or ivory tower, maybe.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Fairly near to us was Southend Central railway station, so
people could come to visit us by
train very easily. Just before that was Southend central shops. You could buy things
there. Between us and the sea was about 10 minutes walk through grotty seaside
avenues, down to the brash, vulgar glitzy promenade where you really could buy kiss-me-quick
hats and eat pie and mash. There was a super funfair with all sorts of rides and vile
hotdogs on which you could squeeze brown, red and yellow stuff. I love all this
stuff to this day, but
Babs was always less sure about it.&nbsp;</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana">If you strayed a little further you could reach Westcliff, which
was much more civilised.
You could visit the Bandstand, where every afternoon an old chap still plays ballroom dance music
on an old organ (no sniggering, at the back) and couples so old they can hardly walk are
seen gliding around the little dancefloor with an extraordinary grace. Some of the old
boys wear their medals, and the ladies dress up. Its a real sight to see. We loved it. When
I am that old, I wonder, will I be able to dance like that? I do hope so.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">That's my house/s. What about yours? If you send me some facts about where you live, or even a link,
I can put it here! Yes, right
here. Go on, what are you waiting for??</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Here is a submission from Mary Hansen:<br>
<font size="2">Hello. I live in a big, square, Prairie-Gothic farmhouse in the SW corner
of Wisconsin. The house and farm are 3 miles south of Viola a town the same size as
Wicken. As with your situation, we have to travel 15 miles to do most types of shopping.
The house and farm are in the Kickapoo Valley which is named after an Indian tribe that
never lived here.( DIGRESSION - The Kickapoo Tribe still exists in two parts. One group
has their own reservation in Oklahoma and is served with a Quaker church. The other group
spends half the year in Mexico and the other half camped in the flood plain of the Rio
Grande beneath a K-Mart Department Store on the Texas side. A city water spigot is
provided them.) The Kickapoo Valley has a 1/2 mile wide floodplain and is walled by steep
450' slopes covered with maple woods. On summer mornings we have heavy fogs allowing
certain plant species to survive here since the last ice age that otherwise exist only
hundreds of miles to the north. The glaciers went completely around the Kickapoo Valley in
that last ice age. My wife grew up in California, I in Detroit. We moved here 20 years ago
without a job and not knowing anyone here. When she wrote her parents a letter to tell
them where we had wound up, her father replied that his father was from the Kickapoo
Valley and so were three generations before him. This is 2000 miles from California. A
wonder-ful coincidence. </font></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE HOUSE. Built in 1926 by Scotch immigrants of a mid-west design.
28'x28',two floors, basement of fieldstone walls, and a duck your head attic. Full porch
across the front nice to sit in if the mosquitoes aren't bad and a screened side porch. A
pretty much remodelled kitchen-an ongoing project-lots of lights and a large window.
Living room and dining room with oak floors which need refinishing. 4 bedrooms and a small
&quot;office&quot; which is actually more of a place to hide clutter when company comes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is probably wordier than your request bode. [Certainly not! M] I
enjoyed your home page.</font></p>
