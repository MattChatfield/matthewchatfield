        He walked with knock-knees and shouted loudly during the night. He was 
        a good cat, and performed his duties effectively to the end. Charlie died 
        in September 2004, aged around about 10. I don't know exactly how old 
        he was - and nor did he. It never seemed to bother him. </p>
    <p><b>One morning</b> many years ago a neighbour walked up our path and said &quot;We've
    found this cat, and as you've already got one black one we thought you'd like it.&quot;
    And so it was.</p>
      <p><b>Charlie once</b> caught a Daubenton's Bat and brought it into the 
        house. It was nearly dead but as I wanted to keep it I put it in the freezer 
        to finish it off kindly. For some reason others thought that this was 
        terribly cruel. Charlie was not too impressed either.</td>

<p>Charlie was so named (by his finder, not by me) after a TV character in public 
  information films, who was, strange to say, a cat. Now, I remember the character 
  as a black cat, but a recent discovery on the Web: <a href="https://youtu.be/y3FnCiRpdQ4">Charley 
  Says - Dont Talk To Strangers</a> - shows that not only was the original Charley 
  not black at all, but he even spelt his name differently. So our Charlie might 
  as well have been named after my uncle Charlie - except I don't have one.</p>
