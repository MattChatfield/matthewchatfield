			<div class="col-md-12"><p><span class="header">Born in Sussex</span>, 
          1967, to a clergy family, his arrival was heralded by a cartoon in the 
          local paper suggesting that his mother, Janet, was about to bear three 
          other sons named Mark, Luke and John. This did not occur, for which 
          he was heartily grateful and no doubt so was she. </p>
        <p><span class="header">His father</span>, Norman, was a Canon Residentiary 
          at Gloucester Cathedral until 2002, when he retired. No, he wasn't fired. 
          Matthew was brought up, indeed, as the son of a gun. </p>
        <p><span class="header">Along with his two sisters</span> Bec and Liz 
          his childhood was spent on the Isle of Wight and in various parts of 
          South Hampshire. Living in sundry vicarages for most of that time he 
          became adept at dealing with questions such as &quot;Are you going to 
          be a monk when you grow up?&quot;; &quot;Is your dad a Catholic or Protestant?&quot; 
          (think about that one for a bit); and &quot;Don't you sound like your 
          father?&quot;</p></div>
