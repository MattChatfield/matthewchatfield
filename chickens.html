These were our chickens. They were<em> Light Sussex bantams</em>.</p>

<p align="center">They were called </p>

<ul>
    <li>Chanticleer </li>
    <li>Pertelot </li>
    <li>Thora the Bird </li>
</ul>

<p>They lived in our garden for a year or so quite a while ago, and then the fox
ate them. Sorry, but it's true. </p>

<p>That's enough about chickens for now. For more information,
see the famous work by Shakespeare on the subject:<em> Timon O Fat
Hens</em>.</p>
