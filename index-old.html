    <p><strong>Born in Sussex</strong> in the 1960s, to a clergy family, his arrival was heralded by a cartoon in the
      local paper suggesting that his mother, Janet, was about to bear three other sons named Mark, Luke and John. This did not
      occur, for which he was heartily grateful and no doubt so was she.</p>

    <p><strong>His father</strong>, Norman, was a Canon Residentiary at Gloucester Cathedral until 2002, when he
      retired. No, he wasn't fired. Matthew was brought up, indeed, as the son of a gun.</p>

    <p><strong>Along with his two sisters</strong> Bec and Liz his childhood was spent on the Isle of Wight and in
      various parts of South Hampshire. Living in sundry vicarages for most of that time he became adept at dealing with
      questions such as "Are you going to be a monk when you grow up?"; "Is your dad a Catholic or
      Protestant?" (think about that one for a bit); and "Don't you sound like your father?"</p>

          Matthew's first moment of fame was appearing on Central TV's Blockbusters quiz in about 1984.
          He got numerous questions wrong but won £205, and had several more questions subtly edited as
          he was too impertinent to <a href="http://www.ukgameshows.com/page/index.php/Blockbusters">Bob Holness</a>.

    <p><strong>This heady moment</strong> was followed by leading his school team to complete
      disaster on BBC radio Top Of The Form, indeed so badly did they do that the whole series was halted shortly after, and
      has not been heard since.</p>

    <p><strong>Matthew went to University</strong> at Durham, where he read Zoology and
      attended Van Mildert College. There he, along with a few colleagues, skated the thin ice of satire with the
      ground-breaking publication Unknown Pleasure. This offended almost everyone, and lost large sums of money. It remains one
      of his proudest achievements. In more recent years he attempted to relive those heady days by intermittently contributing
      improprietous material to the shortlived tongue-in-cheek staff magazine Desk Jockey at the Isle of Wight Council. This
      was never available publicly, which was probably for the best.</p>

    <p><strong>After leaving Durham</strong> fairly hastily he worked voluntarily for the
      <a href="https://tcv.org.uk/">British Trust for Conservation Volunteers</a>, for want of anything better to do.</p>

    <p>
      Eventually Hampshire County Council were rash enough to offer him a job as a ranger, and were able to get rid of him
      five years later having made him Senior Ranger and then Site Manager of Westwood Woodland Park, Southampton. With new
      wife Babs he then joined the National Trust as its youngest Property Manager ever, working at
      <a href="https://www.wicken.org.uk/">Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve</a> until June 1997. During this time he learnt about
      how to live in the country, wear a tweed jacket and talk about 'dirty carrots' with a straight face. He also became
      father to Bill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Matthew was then employed by Basildon District Council as Manager of Countryside Services. Despite knowing nothing
      about boats except <a href="https://naturenet.net/chat/ferry.html">how to get onto the Gosport Ferry without paying</a>,
      he was also in charge of Wat Tyler Marina and the National Motorboat Museum. In summer 1998 his
      second son, Jack was born an Essex boy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>After this merry-go-round of jobs</strong>, in February 1999 he arrived, and still remains, back on
      the <a href="https://www.iwight.com">Isle of Wight</a>; more or less where his adventures began. He worked for the Isle
      of Wight Council initially as Senior Countryside Officer, and eventually as Parks and Countryside Manager where beaches,
      allotments, horticulture, biodiversity and more were added to his impressive range of things to sound knowledgable about.
      He also unexpectedly found success as a <a href="https://mattandcat.co.uk">local restaurant reviewer</a>. From 2011 to 2020
      he divided his time equally between working for the council and his own design and media company,
      <a href="https://pinkeyegraphics.co.uk">Pinkeye Graphics Ltd</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2016 the council finally worked out how to get rid of Matthew without paying him off, and to make sure it stuck
      they abolished the entire countryside section, transferring Matthew, plus most of the sites and staff to a hitherto small
      environmental charity on the Isle of Wight called <a href="http://gifttonature.org.uk">Gift to Nature</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inevitably, that didn't last, and within a couple of years Matthew was back working for the council, this time as
      a Communications and Engagement Officer - Gift to Nature carrying on without him. This world of press releases,
      conferences and regeneration was a far cry from falling into muddy puddles for a living, and proved surprisingly
      successful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sooner or later he moved jobs again, for the first time ever employed full-time in the private sector making websites
      for <a href="https://matrixcreate.com/">Matrix Create, part of LOCALiQ</a>. This website isn't one of them.

      <p>Matthew has appeared on TV's Countryfile programme talking knowledgeably about several things he knows nothing about</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      <strong>Media triumphs</strong> include appearing in the Isle of Wight County Press as 'Michelle Chadwick' - complete
      with photograph; reviewing the morning papers on BBC Radio Solent and BBC Radio Cambridgeshire; having a picture he did
      not take credited to him in The Guardian; hosting a TV crew from Channel 4 who insisted on spraying leopard urine all
      over the place; being the subject of a vitriolic attack by the famed 'Twitcher in the Swamp' in British Wildlife
      Magazine; actually getting a regular column in his beloved
      <a href="http://www.iwcp.co.uk/">Isle of Wight County Press</a>; being banned from several Island pubs on the strength of
      a single review, and publicly supervising (from a great distance) the removal of about five years worth of foetid
      sewage from a levitating manhole in Basildon. Surely the only way is up?

      <strong>Matthew enjoys</strong> talking and writing about the Isle of Wight, eating local produce, preferably all at
      the same time! He also likes <a href="https://pinkeyegraphics.co.uk">designing websites</a>,
      <a href="https://mattandcat.co.uk">eating out</a>, reading, shooting aliens (he will play video games when nothing more
      entertaining presents itself), walking in the countryside and
      <a href="http://naturenet.net/blogs/2006/05/14/tell-me-just-how-can-you-install-a-gate-upside-down/">collecting gates</a>.
