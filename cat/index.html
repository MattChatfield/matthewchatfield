<p class="body"> <span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="title">nce upon a time</span><span class="body">...there
    was a little girl who dreamed of becoming an artist. She would spend hours
    drawing pictures of her cat, Myshkin, and house plants and, well... just
    about anything that would be still for long enough. Her favourite medium
    was felt tipped pens. She also liked making collages and glueing stuff onto
    sugar paper.However, before her discovery of felt tipped pens, L'il Cat worked
    exclusively in crayon - as always drawing from life - see 'Mummy Chasing
    Daddy' - aged 4 (right). She also liked colouring in, particularly abstract
    and geometric patterns. With little girls, it&#8217;s always the same 
  artistic route from crayons and chalk to felt-tipped pens; the pens&#8217; neat 
  and satisfying newness enabling bright and stripy works of art. Too soon followed 
  by desperate licking at their felty ends to extract the final dregs of colour 
  until the nibs splay, exhausted and dry &#8211; then discarded. Realising that,
  by becoming an artist might she might not have to find a proper job</a>, Cat became an art skool flunky. She waved a two fingered goodbye to 
  school and started a Foundation Course at Art College. Being a smart girl, she 
  used her time at Art College wisely. She forwent the usual student vices of 
  sex, drugs and a poor diet. Instead she worked hard and keenly and, after four 
  years,</span> <span class="rightpicturebox"><img src="graphics/college2.png" width="250" height="258"><br>

  Hurrah for Cat. However, her natural indolence rose to the fore and, exhausted 
  after her Art College toil, she went straight on the dole, rejecting the world 
  of work and choosing instead to hang out with her dole dependant friends making 
  cine films, going to the launderette and posing around the streets of Southsea 
  in her Ford Anglia. However, nothing entertained her more than fecking about 
  with her appearance and, particularly her hair.<br>
  It was an art installation... Alas, our heroine could not avoid employment forever 
  and, faced with the prospect of keeping herself warm for the winter, she chose 
  instead to enter the world of work so her employer could pick up the heating 
tab. Here are some of the jobs she has done: </span>
<p class="body">Still, it's not all been such a terrible grind 
  working for The Man. There have been some opportunities for self-employment 
  and self expression. </p>
 <p class="body"> Cat has explored a variety of mediums with success &#8211; 
  applying herself to sewing, furniture design and manufacture, stained glass
    window making, wood turning and parquetry, archaeological replica making,
  hairdressing and knitting, ceramics and web design.</p>
<p class="body">Cat never disregards her Art School background and, even 
  in her current administrative job, there are plenty of opportunities for artistic 
  self-expression, plus her extra-curricular arty activities. Cat has recently 
  returned to Art College and is enjoying studying on HNC Graphic Communications 
  course - learning all about 2dimensional design and illustration. Check out
