<h3 align="center"><a name="GIRLS"><font face="Arrus BT">ADVICE
TO YOUNG LADIES ON THE ART OF PLEASING</font></a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">AFFECTATION.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">Of all the things in the world, my
    dear young lady, let not this disqualification be laid to
    your charge; and believe me, that it is mach easier to be <i>natural</i>
    in all you say, or do, than to be <i>constrained</i> in the
    hopes of captivating.</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">WHISPERING.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">There is a fault, - nay, it is a
    downright cruelty, - of which many young ladies are guilty in
    company - that of <i>whispering</i> among themselves at the
    expense of the male portion of the little community, or
    apparently so. The act itself may be harmless or invidious;
    but it is always a fraud upon those present; it is a direct
    infringement of the laws of politeness.</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">CARDS.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">No young lady should sit down to <i>whist</i>
    or <i>chess</i>; they are what may be called 'cast-iron
    games,' and have a tendency to indurate the feelings. A
    round-game, cribbage, or backgammon, are admirable, for they
    do not banish cheerfulness and pleasantry.</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">AWKWARDNESS.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">However well a young lady may walk
    into a room, or dance at a ball, she has sometimes a <i>lolloping</i>
    way of bending forward when she is seated; and, for my life,
    I cannot in my own mind dissever the idea of such a person
    from a SLATTERN. </font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">A SLATTERN.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">If she <i>be</i> this last, she is
    to be pitied indeed! No habit grows more rapidly, or becomes
    more eventually ruinous. If she have this character at
    thirteen years of age, she will at thirty be a burthen (sic)
    to all who have the misfortune to be allied to her!</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">AMIABILITY.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">If amiability be valuable to man in
    his intercourse with the world, it is absolutely essential to
    <i>woman! </i>The range of good qualities which it supposes
    is very extensive; it wholly banishes the most odious blot
    upon her sex, called '<i>satire</i>,' with its attendant
    'sneers,' uncharitable constructions and vituperations.</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">ENVY.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT"><i>Envy</i> is justly called a <i>hag</i>;
    for how can those, who <i>attach importance to themselves</i>
    only in as far as they may be <i>useful and agreeable to
    others</i>, indulge envy?</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">SCANDAL.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT"><i>Scandal</i> is so prevalent, both
    in towns and villages, that its existence has been deemed of
    little moment, and <i>why? </i>Because not one half of it is
    believed. Does then the <i>other half </i>inflict no injury
    upon the libelled? Let us even suppose it does <i>not</i>; -
    is it not a habit which has a tendency to blight in the bud
    all those virtuous and christian feelings, which can alone
    smooth the way to that better world wherein our pilgrimage
    will, we hope, terminate?</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">A SHREW.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">I must candidly confess that I have
    never seen a SHREW: to be sure, I am <i>not married</i>,
    which may in some measure account for the fact; but there is
    something so exceedingly absurd in woman's taking pains to
    create misery for herself, that I cannot help thinking the
    race has well nigh disappeared.</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">A BLUE-STOCKING.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">The age in which we live being
    distinctly that of <i>good sense</i>, I am also sceptical as
    to the existence of BLUE-STOCKINGS. If a lady be
    well-informed, she is only one among millions equally so; and
    if she have learning or science, she keeps it to herself, or
    shews it only in the works wherewith she may favour the
    public.</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">BEAUTY.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">If you are BEAUTIFUL, be not vain of
    the distinction; remember what Addison says, that 'beauty may
    make virtue more intrinsically excellent;' but it may also,
    my fair and lovely auditress, make a way to undermine the
    purity of your soul, and overthrow the fabric of happiness!
    If any man deliberately <i>flatter</i> you, deem it an
    insult, and politely but coldly request him to desist; he has
    plainly a design, alike dishonourable to both, but of which
    you alone may be the repentant and <i>outcast</i> sufferer!
    As to that lighter species of praise, which may spring from
    good-will, you will know how to separate it from the former. </font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">VANITY - DRESS.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">VANITY may also be directed to
    DRESS, - and though not equally fatal, it leads to many ill
    consequences. In truth, DRESS, as a passion, may grow like
    any other, and be the destruction of a husband's quiet: it
    may also, by its train of coincident expenses, ruin his
    prospects, and bring a family to poverty and wretchedness! My
    dear lady, you will know the value of a guinea, when you have
    to <i>borrow</i> it! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">In dress, a young lady should be
    chiefly remarkable for <i>neatness</i>. On the Continent, so
    particular are parents in this respect, that their daughters
    (unmarried) are not permitted to wear any ornament; and the
    same rule prevails in high life among ourselves.</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">CLEANLINESS.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">As to cleanliness, I will only
    briefly remark, that the word <i>lady</i> is entirely
    inapplicable to anyone who may be deficient in this virtue.</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">HUMILITY.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">In order not to be shunned and hated
    by your companions, you will of course avoid an <i>authoritative</i>
    manner, or the aiming at superiority. <i>Religion</i> will
    teach you perpetual lessons of humility, than which no
    quality, combined with simplicity of deportment, is more
    eminently beautiful in women!</font></p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="BLOKES"><font face="Arrus BT">THE
QUALITIES NECESSARY IN A GENTLEMAN.</font></a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">TRUTH.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">As confidence is, as it were, the
    key-stone of society, it must be evident that prevarication
    in any shape must have a tendency to disturb it; and that <i>lying</i>
    must destroy it altogether. The man who tells a lie to hide a
    fault, is a mean and sculking coward; and he who tells one in
    order to perpetuate an injury is a scoundrel. There is also
    another class of men, who make a sinner of the memory, and
    take all opportunities of retailing exaggerated statements of
    their own doings; there are vain men, weak and silly withal,
    who desire to be famous even at the expense of truth. They
    little dream how soon they are found out; and how absurd a
    figure they cut! These persons are extremely tenacious of
    their own property; this is, <i>their own lies</i>; and you
    cannot more surely make such an one your enemy, than by
    adopting a story of his as your own. They put me in mind of
    the unfortunate gentleman who fancied he had swallowed St.
    Paul's, and went about in fear and trembling lest any one
    should swallow <i>him! Truth</i> only can carry you though
    the world respected and beloved by all. </font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">CLEANLINESS.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">A gentleman should be exquisitely
    clean, both in his dress and person. His linen should be
    without a stain. He should, at least <i>once</i> a week,
    resort to one of the numerous baths in the metropolis. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">In <i>shaving</i>, I recommend his
    attention to the precepts of a celebrated cutler in the
    Strand.</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">SOBRIETY.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">A debauched life is fruitful in ills
    to the body and the mind. The monitor, Conscience, is <i>not</i>
    to be lulled, let the mere man of pleasure assert what he
    may; and a broken-down constitution and a wasted fortune are
    poor returns for what was once deemed pleasure, but is past
    away for ever! Under these circumstances, no person can keep
    his place in society, and therefore he ceases to be a
    gentleman. </font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">AMUSEMENTS. </font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">These are, in a great measure,
    indicatory of the gentleman or the blackguard; be therefore
    careful in their selection.</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">ABSENCE OF CANT.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">Cant expressions are an indubitable
    mark of vulgarity.</font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">DIGNITY, &amp;c.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">Dignity of mien, and spirit to repel
    injuries, are essential to a gentleman; and are very distinct
    from <i>pride, </i>which is shocking and repulsive at all
    times<i>.</i></font></p>
    <h4 align="center"><font face="Arrus BT">DILIGENCE.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arrus BT">This is the true road to success;
    and I am persuaded there would be few <i>blockheads</i> in
    the world, if men were more generally diligent. It is
    astonishing how much we might acquire or perform in the hours
    that are devoted to listlessness. </font></p>
