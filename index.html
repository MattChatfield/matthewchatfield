          <p><span class="header">Born in Sussex</span> in the 1960s, to a clergy family, his arrival was heralded by a cartoon in the
          local paper suggesting that his mother, Janet, was about to bear three other sons named Mark, Luke and John. This did not
          occur, for which he was heartily grateful and no doubt so was she.</p>

          <p><span class="header">His father</span>, Norman, was a Canon Residentiary at Gloucester Cathedral until 2002, when he
          retired. No, he wasn't fired. Matthew was brought up, indeed, as the son of a gun.</p>

          <p><span class="header">Along with his two sisters</span> Bec and Liz his childhood was spent on the Isle of Wight and in
          various parts of South Hampshire. Living in sundry vicarages for most of that time he became adept at dealing with
          questions such as &quot;Are you going to be a monk when you grow up?&quot;; &quot;Is your dad a Catholic or
          Protestant?&quot; (think about that one for a bit); and &quot;Don't you sound like your father?&quot;</p>

          <p><span class="header">Matthew went to University</span> <span class="body">at Durham, where he read Zoology and
          attended Van Mildert College. There he, along with a few colleagues, skated the thin ice of satire with the
          ground-breaking publication Unknown Pleasure. This offended almost everyone, and lost large sums of money. It remains one
          of his proudest achievements. In more recent years he attempted to relive those heady days by intermittently contributing
          improprietous material to the shortlived tongue-in-cheek staff magazine Desk Jockey at the Isle of Wight Council. This
          was never available publicly, which was probably for the best.</span></p>

          <p><span class="header">After leaving Durham</span> fairly hastily he worked voluntarily for the <a href=
          "https://tcv.org.uk/">British Trust for Conservation Volunteers</a>, for want of anything better to do.</p>

          <p>Eventually Hampshire County Council were rash enough to offer him a job as a ranger, and were able to get rid of him
          five years later having made him Senior Ranger and then Site Manager of Westwood Woodland Park, Southampton. With new
          wife Babs he then joined the National Trust as its youngest Property Manager ever, working at <a href=
          "https://www.wicken.org.uk/">Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve</a> until June 1997. During this time he learnt about how
          to live in the country, wear a tweed jacket and talk about 'dirty carrots' with a straight face. He also became
          father to Bill.</p>

          <p>Matthew was then employed by Basildon District Council as Manager of Countryside Services. Despite knowing nothing
          about boats except <a name="ferry" href="https://naturenet.net/chat/ferry.html" id="ferry">how to get onto the Gosport
          Ferry without paying</a>, he was also in charge of Wat Tyler Marina and the National Motorboat Museum. In summer 1998 his
          second son, Jack was born an Essex boy.</p>

          <p><span class="header">After this merry-go-round of jobs</span>, in February 1999 he arrived, and still remains, back on
          the <a href="https://www.iwight.com">Isle of Wight</a>; more or less where his adventures began. He worked for the Isle
          of Wight Council initially as Senior Countryside Officer, and eventually as Parks and Countryside Manager where beaches,
          allotments, horticulture, biodiversity and more were added to his impressive range of things to sound knowledgable about.
          He also unexpectedly found success as a <a href="https://mattandcat.co.uk">local restaurant reviewer</a>. From 2011 to 2020
          he divided his time equally between working for the council and his own design and media company, <a href=
          "https://pinkeyegraphics.co.uk">Pinkeye Graphics Ltd</a>.</p>

          <p>In 2016 the council finally worked out how to get rid of Matthew without paying him off, and to make sure it stuck
          they abolished the entire countryside section, transferring Matthew, plus most of the sites and staff to a hitherto small
          environmental charity on the Isle of Wight called <a href="http://gifttonature.org.uk">Gift to Nature</a>.</p>

          <p>Inevitably, that didn't last, and within a couple of years Matthew was back working for the council, this time as
          a Communications and Engagement Officer - Gift to Nature carrying on without him. This world of press releases,
          conferences and regeneration was a far cry from falling into muddy puddles for a living, and proved surprisingly
          successful.</p>
		  
		  <p>Sooner or later he moved jobs again, for the first time ever employed full-time in the private sector making websites for <a href="https://matrixcreate.com/">Matrix Create, part of LOCALiQ</a>. This website isn't one of them.</p>
