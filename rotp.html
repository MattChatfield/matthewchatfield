<h1>Review of This Page</h1>
<hr>
<b>Despite being</b> heralded as a review of this page, the title of this page is actually referring to another page altogether.
<p>
<b>The page</b> is a list of references to reviews such as this one. This review is, therefore, a part of the page. Indeed this is the very essence of it, as it therefore becomes a review of itself. <p>

<b>Many people</b> find this recursiveness an entertaining diversion. Soon they find it an unavoidable obsession... Before long it becomes hard to formulate a sentence, such as this one, without deliberately introducing a paradox or self-reference. Partners, friends and colleagues become baffled!<p>

<b>Luckily</b> I am not such a person, as this sentence demonstrates.<p>

<h4>A Sad Tale...</h4>
The other night, after many, many beers, <a href="index.html">Babs</a> told my friends and colleagues, "Matthew is really into
self-referentialism, aren't you, Matthew?" Not surprisingly, they were sceptical. "Go on," she said, "Do something recursive!" And wouldn't you know it, I just found myself unable to recurse! Still, I managed to curse pretty well. And that has to be a good start.<p><hr>
